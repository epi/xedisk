xedisk - Atari XL/XE Disk Image Utility
=======================================

// This file is in AsciiDoc format. It is the source for README.html.
:Compact-Option:

+xedisk+ is a small command-line utility for manipulating Atari disk image files.
It supports basic operations on raw sectors as well as on files contained on disks.

+xedisk+ is written in http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/[D programming language] and tested
under Windows and Linux (x86). However, it should be possible to build and run it on any
platform, for which D compiler is available.
It is designed to be easily embeddable in build scripts.

Supported disk image formats
----------------------------

Currently only ATR format is supported.

Supported filesystems
---------------------

Currently only MyDos filesystem is supported.

Installation
------------

You need http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html[DMD 2.051], and a GNU compatible make to build +xedisk+.

Go to console window, and, depending on your operating system, type

--------------
> mingw32-make
--------------

or simply

--------------
$ make
--------------

After successful build, you can move file +xedisk.exe+ or +xedisk+ to a directory within your +PATH+.

If you like hacking, you can easily do without make, and you can use different D compiler.

Usage
-----

A general syntax is:

----------------------------
$ xedisk command [disk_image_file] [options] 
----------------------------

You can place options wherever you wish in the command line, as well as bundle
single-letter options together, if they do not require parameters.

If the command does not require writing into image, file is opened as read-only,
so you don't need write access rights to the file.

Feedback
--------

Recommended way to deal with issues concerning +xedisk+ is to clone the repo, fix the bug
or implement missing feature, and commit the changes with meaningful commit message.

If you don't feel so confident digging in undocumented sources, use http://github.com/epi/xedisk/issues[this tracker].

As a last resort, you can also send bug reports, patches and feature requests to +epi at atari8 dot info+.
